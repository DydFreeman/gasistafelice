    This class is meant to be the place where implementing the accounting API 
    for ``Person``-like economic subjects.
    
    Since it's a subclass of  ``AccountingProxy``, it inherits from its parent 
    all the methods and attributes comprising the *generic* accounting API;
    here, you can add whatever logic is needed to augment that generic API,
    tailoring it to the specific needs of the ``Person``' model.

    This class is meant to be the place where implementing the accounting API 
      for ``GAS``-like economic subjects.
      
      Since it's a subclass of  ``AccountingProxy``, it inherits from its parent 
      all the methods and attributes comprising the *generic* accounting API;
      here, you can add whatever logic is needed to augment that generic API,

    --query (orders)

    Return a QuerySet containing all ``GASSupplierOrder``s whose current state is named as ``name``.
          
          Note that is not the same as retrieving every ``GASSupplierOrder`` having a given state,
          since different model instances may be associated to different workflows, and states belonging to 
          different workflows are different even if they are named the same way.
